                        Teachers have switched their classes to be hybrid or online and have chosen to use their comfortable choice of apps or websites as a result of the virus of Covid-19; due to this students are drowning in work and deadlines as usual but with the added factor of many sites. Professors and teachers only visit one while students juggle many classes and sites along with multiple deadlines daily. Our solution is to organize these sites and make it more efficient and effective for everyone!
